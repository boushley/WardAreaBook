Performance
================
1. The Select box names Verify if this list is getting cached? 
2. Caching TODO sweepers wasn't working for the families controller.  I instead used explict action_expire commands

=====================================================================================
Other
================
1. authlogic tests
1. Edit the other families by clicking on the text instead of going to another page.
 - also allow a way to create children
2. Allow Head of an Organization to assign new heads.   
3. Mailings    
    - Newly assigned action items.
    - recently complelted (where I am the requestor)
    - Events for my families
    - Events for my teaching pool visits for my families
4. Clean up the html  There are a lot of spaces and carriage returns
5. Fatten your models.  Event.find_by_etc should be in the models as a method.
7. When an action time is done I would like the completion date inserted instead. (Right now it's just doing the "updated_at" date.
8. Ajax the saving of an action item. DRY you're already doing this in other places.
